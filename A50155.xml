            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>TIS well known, that the late <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi> of this weekly and ancient LECTURE, have been, to insist first on the Affairs of a sincere CONVERSION, and then on the Duties of a pious CONVERSATION. Having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the <hi>former,</hi> we are now entertaining
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98025:3"/> you with our our Discourses and Directions on the latter. And you must Indulge me this Digression, that the fresh News of our <hi>Distress</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> which within this four and twenty Hours arrived unto us, have diverted my Thoughts to <hi>That</hi> which you may behold this Text pointing at.</p>
            <p>I could not <hi>altogether hold my peace at this time,</hi> without obse ving, that we have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Duties</hi> as we have <hi>Objects</hi> to be concerned with. But as one of the <hi>Objects</hi> which we often have before us, is, <hi>The People of God placed in very terrible Distress, and Danger;</hi> thus among the <hi>Duties</hi> then expected from us, none of the least Remarkable and Considerable is, <hi>The venturing of our All, in the service of that holy People.</hi> Such was the <hi>Object,</hi> and such the <hi>Duty</hi> which our Text refers unto. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, had their <hi>All</hi> now just <hi>going</hi> to be <hi>gone,</hi> and a great person is here called upon to venture <hi>All,</hi> for the service of this People that were thus Expiring.</p>
            <p>The words now read, are a message sent by a Renowned <hi>Mordecai,</hi> to the Empress of the World. The whole Book of <hi>Esther</hi> is a commentary upon one Verse in the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Exodus;</hi> and that part of it which we are now upon, claims a particular share of the Exposition. But we must Praeface our Discourse upon it, with a <hi>few,</hi> and but a few,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98025:3"/> Remarks upon the blessed <hi>Mordecai,</hi> that we may <hi>feel</hi> whereabouts we are. Know then that <hi>Mordecai</hi> was a Famous, an Aged, and an Holy Jew. He had been carried into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, with <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> above seventy years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And he <hi>Returned</hi> to, and <hi>Resided</hi> at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> till the work of the <hi>Temple</hi> received its unhappy interruption: but then he <hi>Retired</hi> that he might serve his People in the Court of <hi>Ahashuerus</hi> (who was also called <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi>) there: A very laudable Example! 'twas the effect and effort of a most noble generosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in a worthy Man, when his opportunities to <hi>Do good</hi> were shut up at home, thus to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself unto all the Temptations of a <hi>Princes Court,</hi> that he might there be service, able to the People of God.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Mordecai</hi> gives a great affront un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one <hi>Haman,</hi> a Minion in the Court of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi> That <hi>Haman</hi> by his Brigues, had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Persian Emperour, a Commission and Priviledg to require a more than common Reverence from the Courtiers then about the Palace. But this good man found it against his Conscience to take such a notice of such a Miscreant. The scruple arose in him, either from <hi>This;</hi> That <hi>Haman</hi> was an <hi>Amalekite</hi> he was among the Children of that <hi>Agog,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Samuel</hi> slew; and so of a Generation both <hi>accursed</hi> by God, and no less justly that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98025:4"/> greatly <hi>Abhorred</hi> by <hi>Israel;</hi> or which I rather Think, from <hi>This,</hi> That it was a <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Sacred</hi> Respect, which <hi>Haman</hi> did now require. Such was the respect which the haughty and impious Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> would sometimes arrogate unto themselves; and they would sometimes impart the same unto their Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites and Favourites. Had it been a meer civil respect which was here demanded, it would have been very <hi>superfluous</hi> and well nigh <hi>ridiculous</hi> to have given express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand unto all <hi>the Kings Servants that were in the Court</hi> concerning it; good manners were doubtless enough used there. Now that a godly <hi>Jew</hi> should refuse to render such an Honour to a sorry <hi>Potsheard of the Earth,</hi> is not at to be wondred at, when we call to mind, That even the prudent, but pagan <hi>Grecians</hi> did refuse it, in their Address to the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchs; and the <hi>Athenians</hi> put one <hi>Timocrates</hi> to death, for adoring of <hi>Darius</hi> in such a manner. Such a check was given to the pride of <hi>Haman!</hi> Now the bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of this Hellish Monster prompted him to pursue no meaner a satisfaction for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, than the utter <hi>Desolation</hi> and <hi>Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> of the whole Nation which <hi>Mordecai</hi> was of: one Lark will not fill the belly of such a <hi>Vulture.</hi> Besides he saw the whole Nation was of such <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Perswasions</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98025:4"/> as gave a reproof to his wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; an intolerable Nation was it that would know no God, but the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and with whom <hi>Creature-Worship</hi> was now grown into Detestation: and therefore he procures an order for the total Destruction of all the Jews, to be executed, according to the advice which he sought of the <hi>Divel</hi> for it, about this time of the year; and I suppose <hi>Anno mundi</hi> 3485.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, the <hi>Jews</hi> were before this, grown a little too secure and careless: it might fill them with many promises of none but <hi>Good Times</hi> for them, when they saw one of their own Religion sitting on the Throne. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, The <hi>Jews</hi> had every where offended the God of Heaven, by neglecting of His Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for the sake of their own Secular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations. But we now all of the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den see them that were the <hi>only people of God in the world,</hi> involved in most Awakening and Horrible Calamities; and they have a pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Nothing but a Speedy, a present <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine</hi> before their Eyes. 'Twas by something bigger than a <hi>Wonder,</hi> that the People of God were now preserved!</p>
            <p>A Strange Providence had exalted a Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of <hi>Mordecai's,</hi> whose Name was <hi>Esther,</hi> to be the Queen of the Persian Empire; and she must be the Instrument of the preservation.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98025:5"/> In order hereunto, we find in our Context, a very solemn Message of her Uncle to her; in which we may Contemplate,</p>
            <p>First, a <hi>Duty.</hi> The Duty pressed is, To <hi>venture All for the Rescue of them that were the Afflicted People of God.</hi> The Thing Enjoined upon <hi>Esther</hi> was, <hi>Go in unto the King, and make Supplication for thy people.</hi> This was the only step that could be taken for saving the People of God: but it was one very desperate and perillous. There was a cursed and a crabbed <hi>Law</hi> among them, which made it capital for any uncalled person to come into the <hi>presence</hi> of the King, unless it should please His pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and Soveraign Majesty to Extend His <hi>Golden Scepter,</hi> as a Token of a Pardon for that presumption. Wherefore now to push into the presence of the King, was to rush more evidently upon the point of a <hi>Sharp Sword,</hi> than of a <hi>Golden Scepter;</hi> it was to hazard the Loss of <hi>All;</hi> not only a <hi>Crown,</hi> but a <hi>Life</hi> too must be ventured in it. And the late Carriages of the Emperour unto <hi>Est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her,</hi> could not but increase her Suspicions and Jealousies that his Affections began to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated from her; whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h made the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking yet more Dubious, Dangerous, and Formidable. However, still this was the Charge of the good <hi>Mordecai, If All must be ventured, then venture All; when the People of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98025:5"/> God are perishing, All that we have, is too little to be ventured for their Help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, A <hi>Reason</hi> The Reason is, like a good <hi>Sawce</hi> made up of <hi>Sowre</hi> and <hi>Sweet.</hi> It is made up of <hi>Discords,</hi> and there is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Musick</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>First, We have <hi>Necessity</hi> for this venture mentioned. Says <hi>Mordecai</hi> to his Neece, <hi>Think not that thou shalt escape.</hi> He speaks to her, as to a Passenger Embark'd in the same Vessel. Says he, <hi>Don't think that you shall not share with, and fare like, the rest of the people of God, that are now ready to be swallowed up</hi> It was more probable, that the <hi>Queen</hi> would suffer for being a <hi>Jew,</hi> than that the <hi>Jew</hi> should escape for being a <hi>Queen.</hi> Being a <hi>Queen,</hi> has been found not enough to put a person beyond the Reach of Malice and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; as the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> besides nearer instances, have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured us. A Lively venture for the People of God, was once, it seems, the only way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a <hi>Royal</hi> person from every fatal mischief.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, We have <hi>Encouragement</hi> for this Venture tendered Says <hi>Mordecai</hi> with a Magnanimous Faith. <hi>If thou altogether hold thy peace at this time, there shall Enlargement and Deliverance arise from another place.</hi> Here was that <hi>Faith,</hi> by which, as the Apostle notes, the Believers of old, <hi>Escaped the Edge of the Sword.</hi>

               <hi>From another place.</hi> There are Jewish Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins who look upon <hi>Place,</hi> here to be the Name of God. It has been admired, that the Name of GOD, is no where to be seen in the Book of <hi>Esther;</hi> and the Jews have a profane and foolish Custome thereupon. But indeed, as the Greeks would write <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>

               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, upon their Books, much more may we see <hi>God</hi> in every verse, <hi>God</hi> in every line of this Memorable Book. If the Name of <hi>Makom,</hi> or, <hi>Place</hi> be here put upon our God, it is not without a cause: For, <hi>All things are in God;</hi> He is Immense and Boundless in His Being; we cannot so well say, <hi>That God is in the World,</hi> as, <hi>That the World is in Him;</hi> and whether it be proper or no, to say, That God is even in the <hi>Imaginary Space</hi> beyond the <hi>utmost Selvidge</hi> of the World, this I am sure of, That the <hi>Utmost Selvedge</hi> of the World does not limit and confine this infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God, and the <hi>Heaven of Heavens cannot Contain Him.</hi> 'Tis therefore suggested here, That when the People of God can have no <hi>place</hi> of Safety, but are in every <hi>place</hi> obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to dreadful Persecutions, yet then, in their <hi>GOD</hi> they will have a <hi>place</hi> to repair unto. 'Tis possible, That this Glorious PLACE may keep the worst of all their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies from coming at them?</p>
            <p>But what is the Duty <hi>then</hi> incumbent upon
<pb facs="tcp:98025:6"/>
               <hi>our selves.</hi> You have heard it in the <hi>Text</hi> and you shall again hear it, in our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> thereupon; which is briefly <hi>This.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>That every Christian should Readily and Chearfully <hi>Venture</hi> his All to to serve the people of God, when a <hi>Time of Distress and Danger</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for it.</q>
            <p>It had been both <hi>presumptuous</hi> and <hi>Injurious</hi> to have Exhorted <hi>Estther</hi> unto doing so, if it had not been a Duty altogether indispensable. The Blessed God, for most wise and great <hi>Ends,</hi> permits <hi>Times of Distress and Danger</hi> to come upon His people. That <hi>His Attributes</hi> may be Magnified, and that both His and Their <hi>Adversaries</hi> may be prepared for the Vengeance, which belongs unto them, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis that the most High brings His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sometimes into most amazing Exigencies; 'tis for these causes, that they not rarely fall into such <hi>Times of Distress and Danger,</hi> that like them in the Days of <hi>Esther,</hi> they Ly <hi>mourning and weeping and wailing in Sackcloth and Ashes,</hi> before the Lord; and they see themselves no where but upon the prodigious
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98025:7"/> praecipices of Rumes hardly to be avoided.</p>
            <p>In <hi>such</hi> a condition of Affairs (which is too much <hi>our own</hi> Condition) something must be done; <hi>Attempts</hi> must be made for the Relief and Rescue, of the <hi>People</hi> so likely to be cut off. Tho' it becomes us to, <hi>Stand still, and see the Salvation of God,</hi> I do not know that we are to <hi>sit still,</hi> without the use of Means under our Discouragements. But these <hi>Attempts</hi> can't be made without <hi>Ventures</hi> in them. 'Tis as possible they may miscarry, as that they may be successful. However, we must yet <hi>venture</hi> hard, and <hi>Venture</hi> far, yea, and Venture <hi>All,</hi> to serve the People of God, in their <hi>Distress</hi> and <hi>Danger. If at THIS TIME thou altogether</hi> forbear, and refrain, the doing of what may be serviceable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed People of God, behold with an Holy Terror, the Doom upon that Omission, <hi>Thou and thy House shall be destroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have two <hi>Questions</hi> before us, to be a little Reflected on.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>What,</hi> And</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Why,</hi> we must <hi>Venture</hi> for the Distressed People of God.</p>
            <p>The first of our Questions, is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What Ventures are we to make for the People of God, when Distress or Danger calls?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must make <hi>short work</hi> of it, and in <hi>One Word</hi> comprise what is to be said. I say then,</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98025:7"/>
            <p>
               <hi>We are to Venture every Thing in the world, but a precious and immortal Soul.</hi> So did <hi>Esther</hi> our Pattern. There is no Jewel, but that one of a never dying <hi>Soul,</hi> too valuable to be ventured, when God and His People is to be served. The first Lesson, the A. B. C. of Christianity, is that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Let a man Deny himself.</hi> We are so to <hi>Deny</hi> out selves, as to <hi>Venture</hi> our selves, and <hi>All</hi> that we <hi>Are,</hi> and All that we <hi>Have,</hi> to serve the <hi>People of the Saints of the Most High.</hi> But because you Look to see some particulars in the <hi>Bill of Charges</hi> which the Distress &amp; Danger of Gods People, may put upon you, Let me say;</p>
            <p>First, We must venture our <hi>Quiet,</hi> for the People of God. It was the Speech of a Gallant Man, in 2 Sam. 11.11. <hi>The Ark and Israel and Judah abide in Tents, and my Lord Joab, and the Servants of my Lord are Encamped in the open fields; shall</hi> I <hi>then go into my house, to Eat and to Drink—I will not do this thing,</hi> Well said, thou brave <hi>Hero!</hi> May we in like manner scorn to Consult the Delights and Pleasures of our own Repose, when the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God and His People shall call us forth. Many <hi>Pains,</hi> many <hi>Toyls,</hi> and all the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Fatigues of <hi>Business,</hi> must be Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, without Reluctancies, when the People of God are to be served; and we should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98025:8"/> our soft Beds, our full <hi>Tables,</hi> and our Fine <hi>Houses,</hi> for the sake thereof. We should engage in the Service of our Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' there should be two <hi>Hankerchiefs</hi> which we are thereby necessitated unto the continual wearing of; One to wipe off the <hi>Sweat</hi> of Labour and another to wipe off the <hi>Dirt</hi> of Reproach. We may not, for the Love of <hi>Ease,</hi> decline the doing of what is to be done for the Interest of God, and of His People.</p>
            <p>Again, We must venture our <hi>Estate</hi> for the People of God. It is Recorded for the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Reputation of those well-disposed men, in 2 Cor. 8.2 <hi>Their deep Poverty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded unto the Riches of Liberali?y,</hi> or <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,</hi> as it may be rendred. Many persons can do nothing in a way of Service for the People of God, because they say, <hi>They are poor.</hi> Nay, but our extreamest <hi>Poverty</hi> should not hinder our <hi>Liberality,</hi> When God and His People are to be served with what we have: Whatever <hi>Simplicity</hi> the Wity and Crafty and Gripple Hold-fasts of the World, may imagine in it. We should not grumble at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Expences</hi> which the Service of God and His People is to be maintained with; and tho' we have no more than <hi>Two Mites</hi> to give, we should part with more than <hi>One</hi> of them, rather than his Interest should meet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98025:8"/> with any prejudice.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we must venture our <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> for the People of God. It was an Act for which <hi>Moses</hi> is for ever <hi>Honourable,</hi> in Heb 11.24, 25. <hi>He Refused to be called, The Son of</hi> Pharaohs Daughter, <hi>choosing rather to suffer Affliction, with the People of God:</hi> Tho' we may arise to never so much Grandeur, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Preferment, by overlooking the Service of God and His People, we should think <hi>Little</hi> of the <hi>Grandeur,</hi> and rather trample upon such Dignity and Preferment. Tho' our Titles may be, <hi>Reverend,</hi> or <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful,</hi> or <hi>Honourable,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Rightly</hi> so too; nevertheless we should think it no <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> to us, that the People of God must be served by us. We are swoln with the <hi>vainest Air,</hi> if we count our selves too Bigg to do what is bespoke for the Interest of those that we should be <hi>Benefactors</hi> unto, if we would not unworthily pretend to be <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> over them.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we must venture our <hi>Friends</hi> for the people of God. The Lord General of <hi>Israel</hi> had a dear and a kind <hi>Brother,</hi> to whom nevertheless he said, as in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10, 11, 12. <hi>Be of good Courage, let us play the men for our People: and the Lord do that which seemeth Him good.</hi> Tho it be a <hi>Brother,</hi> yea, and somewhat nearer than a <hi>Brother</hi> that we must
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98025:9"/> part withal, for the Service of God and His People, yet we must be willing to take our leave of such Rela ions. It was a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Bravery in that Father, who having had <hi>six</hi> lovely and loving <hi>Sons</hi> kill'd in the Service of the Public, brought out a <hi>seventh,</hi> even the Staff of his old <hi>Age,</hi> unto the Press-Masters, and said <hi>Here I have one Son more; take him too; this cause is worth them all.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we have a <hi>Benjamin</hi> with us, which we dote so much upon, that our Gray hairs do with <hi>sad hearts</hi> tremble at his departure from us: yet <hi>Benjamin</hi> too mu t go, if the service of our <hi>Joseph,</hi> our Jesus have occasion for him. There are many persons, who have brought very bitter, woful, doleful Miseries upon their <hi>Children,</hi> by detaining them from the Service of Gods People, when some hazard has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in it. Let us count the very best of our <hi>Friends,</hi> never better bestowed, than in such a <hi>Service</hi> as may be reputed a <hi>Friendship</hi> to the Interest of God.</p>
            <p>All that I have hitherto asked for, is but a <hi>Small Venture;</hi> there is <hi>One</hi> more that we are to make.</p>
            <p>Finally then, We are to venture our very LIVES for the People of God, when they can't be brought out of <hi>Distress</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> without the venture of our <hi>Lives.</hi> 'Tis what we are summoned unto in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98025:9"/> 16. <hi>We ought to lay down our Lives for the Brethren.</hi> If an Heathen <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Orestes</hi> could not think their <hi>Lives</hi> too large a price for each others <hi>Peace,</hi> what <hi>Life</hi> should be too much to be Sacrificed for the <hi>Peace</hi> of a People which God counts <hi>His own?</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>For a good man one would even dare to Dy</hi> and hee saw it when an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> were so ready to Dy for <hi>him.</hi> If a <hi>good Person</hi> be so valuable, What can then bee too much for a <hi>Good People</hi> of the Lord? When <hi>Adron,</hi> when <hi>David,</hi> beheld a Destroying Evil breaking in upon the People of God, they carried their <hi>Lives</hi> to keep it off. We are to do what we can for such a People, tho it be with <hi>The Jeopardy of our Lives.</hi> If we have a call to <hi>Ride into the very Bowels of the Earth,</hi> for the Service of the Public, we should as <hi>He</hi> of old, with all Spur and Speed be there. The Service of God and His People should make us to say, as the Martyr once, <hi>If every Hair of my Head were a Man, they should all be Sacrificed in this Glorious cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are <hi>Ventures</hi> that we should none of us be Backward unto. But our Second Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion then Enquires.</p>
            <q>Why are such Ventures to be made for the People of God, when a Pressing Time cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for them.</q>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:98025:10"/>
            <p>Briefly, We ow our <hi>All</hi> unto the <hi>People</hi> of God. A <hi>Minister</hi> of God said once unto another, Philem. 19. <hi>Thou owest unto me, even thine own self.</hi> How much more may the <hi>People</hi> of God say this unto us all, <hi>Thou owest us thy self and thy All;</hi> The People of God may call for our <hi>All</hi> And</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Order</hi> of God Empowers the <hi>People</hi> of God, to call for it. We are <hi>His</hi> by <hi>Creation. He has made us and not we our selves.</hi> We are <hi>His</hi> by <hi>Redemption.</hi> He has <hi>Bought us and not for our selves.</hi> Our God says unto us, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Ye are not your own.</hi> That which He has done for us, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to say unto <hi>Him</hi> devoutly what the Prince of old foolishly said unto another, I <hi>am thine, and all that</hi> I <hi>have.</hi> Shall I not add, That we are <hi>His</hi> by <hi>Profession</hi> too? I pray, which of you dare to say, I <hi>have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that God is not the Owner of?</hi> We <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess</hi> that all we can Style <hi>our own,</hi> shall be, <hi>For Him and not for another;</hi> otherwise we ly in our dayly Protestations. We have our <hi>All</hi> from God. It is, <hi>In Him that we Live and Move and have our Being.</hi> And shall not our <hi>All</hi> be <hi>For</hi> Him too? Well, The God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has made His People, the Receivers of His <hi>Rents,</hi> His <hi>Dues.</hi> They have a <hi>Letter of Atturney</hi> for it; and you shall see me produce it, before I stirr. It is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.40. <hi>Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as you have done it unto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98025:10"/> the least of these my Brethren,</hi> (Blessed Lord, Condescendest thou to Style thy poor People so? and shall we count any thing too dear to be Ventured for them!) <hi>Ye have done it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Design</hi> of God likewise Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers them to call for it. All Things are Ordained and Intended by our Good God, for the use of His People; He says in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. <hi>All is yours.</hi> And shall we defraud them as to any part of that <hi>All?</hi> What is it that God allowes us our <hi>Life</hi> and all the Refreshments and Enjoyments of it for? Tis not that <hi>we</hi> may have a Tast of a few Sensual Delights; God has not that Regard unto our <hi>Sensuality.</hi> No, Tis that the People of God may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it; therefore tis that we are made <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> of our little <hi>All.</hi> Why, the whole World stands on this very Ground, <hi>That the People of God may be Provided for;</hi> if there were none of <hi>them</hi> to be Served the Eternal God, would with swift Lightenings and Hot Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts, immediately set fire to the Universe. How comes the Greatest <hi>King</hi> to set upon a Chair of State? It is affirmed of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issant Emperour, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.4 <hi>For Jacob my Servants sake, and for Israel mine Elect,</hi> I <hi>have called thee.</hi> Much more ought we <hi>Little Folks</hi> to imagine, that when we have arrived unto any thing of the World, the Almighty God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98025:11"/> says unto us, <hi>Tis for the Sake and the Service of my Israel, that</hi> I <hi>have Blessed thee.</hi> Shall I utter a word beyond any that has yet passed from me? We are then to be Sensible of what we read about our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22. <hi>God hath put all things under His Feet:</hi> What for? It followes, <hi>And gave Him to be Head over all things to the Church</hi> What a thing is here? It seems that our Lord Jesus is made <hi>Heir of all things,</hi> and has the Government of the whole World put into His Hands, (in part) that so the People of God may thereby be Served &amp; Saved forever more, And what shall you and I, Little Creatures, then think of all the <hi>Advantages</hi> which God has put into <hi>our</hi> Hands! Whom, I pray, <hi>Whom</hi> are they to be Serviceable to?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Glory</hi> of God, gives them a Concernment in our <hi>All.</hi> 'Tis the Name worn by the People of God in Isa. 46.13. <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, my Glory.</hi> The Lord our God has more <hi>glory</hi> from His People, than from all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible World besides. Indeed all the Sincere and Active Returns of <hi>glory</hi> which from the face of the Earth go up unto Him, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong such as these. The Great God is greatly <hi>Glorify'd</hi> by the prosperity of His People, <hi>They</hi> Know Him, <hi>They</hi> Love Him, <hi>They</hi> Praise Him, while <hi>Prosperity</hi> gives them <hi>Opportunity</hi> so to do; and as 'tis said in Psal,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98025:11"/> 102.16. <hi>When the Lord shall build up Zion, He shall appear in His Glory.</hi> The <hi>Glory</hi> of God is promoted, when the <hi>Zion</hi> of God is Defended, Enlarged, Served. And what should we Dedicate and Consecrate our <hi>All</hi> unto, but the <hi>Glory</hi> of Him that is <hi>God over All?</hi> 'Tis said, <hi>Eat and Drink unto the Glory of God;</hi> every Bit of <hi>Meat,</hi> every Drop of <hi>Drink,</hi> that we have; and whatever is reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in our <hi>All,</hi> may be devoted unto the <hi>Glory</hi> of God. If <hi>so,</hi> it must go to the <hi>Service</hi> of His People too.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The <hi>Wrong</hi> we have done to the People of God, Enables them to Demand our <hi>All.</hi> What is it that brings <hi>Distress</hi> or <hi>Danger</hi> upon the People of God? It is, <hi>Our Sin.</hi> We, by our <hi>Sins</hi> have had an Hand in all the Inconveniencies, which put the People of God upon calling for our Help? How shall we then repair this Wrong, but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering our <hi>All,</hi> to bring them out of their Distressed Plight? Hence came that carriage of <hi>David,</hi> in 2 Sam 24.17. <hi>He said,</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98025:12"/> of them.</hi> This was that which poured Oyl into the Flame of that <hi>Zeal</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> was once inspired with; He could say, I <hi>was once Injurious!</hi> and this made him with a scarce imitable Diligence and Faithfulness, now lay out His <hi>All,</hi> to serve the People of God, who had heretofore been worse for his Misdemeanours.</p>
            <p>But the Improvement of these things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. And it shall be in these Deductions.</p>
            <div n="1" type="deduction">
               <head>Deduction I.</head>
               <p>Hence, a <hi>private Spirit,</hi> especially at a Time of much <hi>Distress</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> with the People of God, is an evil much to be Rebuked. For us to see the People of God gasping, bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dying under Difficulties, and yet, <hi>At this Time altogether to hold our peace!</hi> O 'tis a most unaccountable <hi>Baseness;</hi> and the mouth of our God hath stigmatized it with the charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of most horrible <hi>Woes;</hi> as in Amos 6.6. <hi>Wo to them, that are not grieved for the Affil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Joseph!</hi> I lay down these two Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>First, At <hi>All</hi> Times we should <hi>Employ</hi> our <hi>All</hi> for the People of God It should be our Ambition to be as the Blessed <hi>Bradford</hi> was, <hi>Always doing of Good with Tongues, or Pen, or Purse, or some other way.</hi> Most amiable was the Meditation, which <hi>David</hi> was treating himself withal, in 2 Sam. 7:2. <hi>He sits down
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98025:12"/> in his House,</hi> and thinks. <hi>What shall I do for the House of my God?</hi> That Enquiry, <hi>What Service may</hi> I <hi>do for the Church of God?</hi> should often be Rolled in our Minds; and it will be so, if we do not too much countenance a <hi>Spiritual Barrenness</hi> in our Lives. The Church of God, is well worth our <hi>Serving;</hi> next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Man</hi> Christ Jesus, it is the Noblest Creature that ever was formed by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Curious Hand of the <hi>Great God that formed all things.</hi> There is not an <hi>Angel</hi> in Heaven, but what would g adly wait upon the smallest and poorest Member in the <hi>Church-Mystical;</hi> even so, the <hi>Little Ones have their Angels.</hi> Yea, our Mighty <hi>Saviour</hi> Himself, counted the very <hi>Blood of God,</hi> and <hi>Life of God</hi> a fit Ransome for the Salvation of of the Church; and shall not we then reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church and People of God a fit sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for the best of our sorry Services? But I pass on to say,</p>
               <p>Secondly, In Times of much <hi>Distress</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> with the People of God, we are then especially to <hi>Venture</hi> our All on their behalf.

Tis wonderful if the Sentence upon the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Fig-tree, be not pass'd upon us, <hi>Cut them down!</hi> with an eye to the Execution of that Sentence upon the Jewes, we find mentioned, in Isai. 66 6. <hi>A Voice from the City, a Voice from the Temple, a Voice of the Lord.</hi> Even so, at this Time, there is a <hi>Voice</hi> coming from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every side of us; there is a <hi>Voice</hi> from the <hi>North,</hi> a <hi>Voice</hi> from the <hi>East,</hi> a <hi>Voice</hi> from the <hi>West;</hi> a <hi>Voice,</hi> as Loud as that in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which gave Terrour to all this Land a few Months ago. What says this <hi>Voice,</hi> but this, <hi>They are going to be Cut down for ever.</hi> This is the <hi>Voice</hi> of the Combinations, which our Adversaries have made against us; this is the <hi>Voice</hi> of the strange Distractions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions which the <hi>Quarrel-some</hi> among our selves do infest us withall; and this is the <hi>Voice</hi> of all our Fears. <hi>Every thing looks Black.</hi> For my own part, I freely confess, what issue my own Thoughts are come unto: Tis, That if
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98025:19"/> the Blessed God intend that the Divel shall keep <hi>America</hi> during the Happy <hi>Chiliad</hi> which His Church is now very <hi>quickly</hi> Entring into, (I say, very <hi>quickly,</hi> for tis now past Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with me, <hi>That the Second Wo is past;</hi> and the <hi>Third</hi> you know then <hi>Cometh quickly</hi>) then our Lord Jesus will within a few Months break up House among us, and we go for our Lodging either to <hi>Heaven</hi> or to <hi>Europe</hi> in a very little while. But if our God will wrest <hi>America</hi> out of the Hands of its old Land-Lord, <hi>Satan,</hi> and give these <hi>utmost ends of the Earth</hi> to our Lord Jesus, than our present conflicts will shortly be blown over, and something better than, <hi>A Golden Age,</hi> will arrive to this place, and this perhaps before all of our <hi>First Planters</hi> are fallen a sleep. Now, Tis a dismal <hi>Uncertainty</hi> and <hi>Ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> that we see ourselves placed in. Briefly, such is our case, <hi>That something must be done out of hand.</hi> And indeed, our <hi>All is at the Stake;</hi> we are beset with a Thousand Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities and Entanglements. The Question which we have now before us, in short is This, <hi>Whether we will venture All, with an Hope to Preserve All,</hi> or <hi>Whether we will keep All, with an Assurance to Loose All, by doing so.</hi>

It was an Expression used once by a most hearty Servant of <hi>New-England,</hi> (the Honourable <hi>William Stoughton</hi>) to a very gerat Assembly, <hi>God Sifted Three Nations, that He might bring choice Grain into this Wilderness.</hi> The <hi>Product</hi> of that <hi>choice Grain,</hi> is that which now calls for our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures. If <hi>New-England</hi> miscarry, there will then fall some Thousands of People that <hi>Love the Lord Jesus Christ in Sincerity,</hi> and that are affectionately <hi>Acknowledging of Him in all their ways.</hi> But if Things go well with <hi>New-England,</hi> there will Myriads of Praises be continually going up from hence unto the <hi>God of our Fathers.</hi> Our God will be <hi>Praised</hi> here, for our Deliverances, yea,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98025:20"/> shall I say it? He will be <hi>Praised</hi> for it in the Third Heaven too. as it was said, in Rev. 18.20. <hi>Rejoyce over her, thou Heaven.</hi> If <hi>Heaven</hi> will <hi>Rejoice</hi> at the <hi>Destruction</hi> of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> it will also <hi>Rejoice</hi> at the <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> which tho it be in the same Latitude with <hi>Italy,</hi> is yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Sincerest of its <hi>Antipodes.</hi> In the Day when poor <hi>New-England</hi> shall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from its present Extremities, Then, <hi>Rejoyce over her, thou Heaven.</hi> Doubtless, There will Tidings be carried unto <hi>Heaven</hi> of it; and it may be <hi>particularly</hi> notify'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those good old men that went from hence to those Blessed Regions. Our Predecessors which are gone to the <hi>Spirits of just men made perfect,</hi> may hear what a Deliverance God has wrought for their poor Children here; and <hi>Heaven</hi> will then Ring with Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Praises to the great Saviour of <hi>New-England,</hi> who can withold his <hi>All</hi> from the Service of <hi>such</hi> a People? Me thinks, I should say as the Martyr once, <hi>A loss, That</hi> I <hi>have but one Life to loose!</hi> Tis <hi>Immanuels Land</hi> that we Venture for.

            <p>This COURT have therefore thought it needful to praeface their other Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the Publick Welfare, with a very solemn Admonition unto this whole People, that they every where give De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of a thorough <hi>Repentance,</hi> without which we have little reason to hope for any good succese in our Affairs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is Ordered, that the Laws

            </p>
            <p>And as all Persons are hereby warned to avoid those <hi>Vices</hi> which these <hi>Laws</hi> are designed for the Prevention and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of (the <hi>Lovers</hi> of, and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> for, such Iniquities, being among the principal <hi>Troublers</hi> of their Countrey) So all inferiour <hi>Officers</hi> are enjoyn'd to perform their Duty in finding and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Offenders against the aforesaid <hi>Laws,</hi> and withal to give notice to such

            <p>And that no attempt towards <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> may want that Assistance which all good men will be willing to give the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reunto, 'tis hoped that the Ministers of God will to the publick Reading of this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> adjoyn their own fervent Labours, not only for the Rebukeing and Suppressing of those <hi>Provoking Evils,</hi> which are marked for common Hatred: but also to witness against the more <hi>Spiritual Sins,</hi> which fall not so much under the cognizance of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Laws,</hi> namely, such as <hi>Ʋnbelief, Worldliness, Heresy, Pride, Wrath, Strife, Envy,</hi> and the <hi>Neglect</hi> of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, in both Natural and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted <hi>Worship,</hi> and the <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>everlasting Gospel,</hi> with a shameful want of due <hi>Family-Instruction,</hi> which are the <hi>Roots of Bitterness</hi> in the midst of us.</p>
            <p>Moreover, after the Example of <hi>Pious Rulers</hi> commended in Sacred Writ; the <hi>Churches</hi> every where are hereby advised to give utmost Encouragement unto the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98025:27"/> Faithful and Watchful <hi>Pastors</hi> of their Souls; to seek (where they <hi>lack</hi>) a full Settlement and Enjoyment of such <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> as the Lord Jesus Christ has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Edification; to reflect seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and frequently on their <hi>Covenants,</hi> to sharpen their <hi>Discipline</hi> against those that <hi>walk disorderly;</hi> and immediately to compose their <hi>Differences</hi> and <hi>Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (if <hi>such</hi> there be) whereby any of them may be distempered and enfeeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that so they may become <hi>Terrible as an Army with Banners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore it is Expected that the several <hi>Towns</hi> within this Jurisdiction do speedily furnish themselves with all fit means for the good <hi>Education of Youth,</hi> and take special care to avoid <hi>Factions</hi> &amp; <hi>Quarrels</hi> in their other <hi>Town Affairs;</hi> and all Plantations are strictly forbidden to continue without the Advantages of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Word</hi> of God constantly preacht unto them, or without a Sincere and Active Industry, to obtain the Presence of the Lord Christ in all His blessed <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</hi>

            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:98025:28"/>
            <p>And Finally, this whole People are hereby advertised, that if these <hi>Essayes</hi> for an universal Reformation, shall be obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted (as those in the dayes of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Josiah</hi> were) by Mens being <hi>settled on their Lees,</hi> and <hi>hating to be Reformed,</hi> they can reasonably look for no other issue than this, that the jealous God <hi>will punish them yet seven times more for their iniquities:</hi> But, that if the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven shall grant unto them the Grace to <hi>Remember whence they are fallen, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and do the first Works,</hi> it will give a greater Prospect of <hi>Prosperity,</hi> than can arise from the best <hi>Counsels,</hi> and biggest <hi>Armies.</hi>

            <p>The Work of <hi>Reformation</hi> thus <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,</hi> is now <hi>recommended</hi> unto the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Almighty, with whom alone it is, to Recover a Backsliding people; perswading our selves, that the Event thereof would be <hi>Salvation nigh unto us, and Glory dwelling in our Land.</hi>
